# telegramR
An R wrapper for the Telegram Bot API. 

## Description

This package makes use of the rather new API of mobile messaging service Telegram. Get notifications from R straight to your cell phone.
Like this, you can receive updates if a time-consuming simulation has finished. 

## Installation

For the initial set up, you have to creat a Telegram bot which will act as the contact sending you updates from R.

Further instructions will follow shortly.

## Future plans 

Future plans for this package include adding functionalities such as possibility of sending plots and reports (in html or pdf).
