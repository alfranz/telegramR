# telegramR
An R wrapper for the Telegram Bot API. 

## Description

This package makes use of the rather new bot API of mobile messaging service [Telegram](https://telegram.org/). Get notifications from R straight to your cell phone (for example when that time-consuming simulation finally has finished!). 

## Installation

For the initial set up, you have to create a so-called Telegram bot through a client of your choice. We'll need the (rather long) HTTP token, so a desktop client will be easier to copy the token into R.  

Further instructions will follow shortly.

## Future plans 

Future plans for this package include adding functionalities such as the possibility of sending plots and knitr reports (e.g. in html or pdf format). Also, the installation process is a bit tedious and could be made easier.
